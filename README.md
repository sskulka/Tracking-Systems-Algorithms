# Tracking Systems Algorithms
 Repository contains tracking algorithms viz KF, EKF and PF with behavioral robotics
 
 > Lab 4 contains a 1D and 2D Kalman Filter for a given data whose state transitions and state update equations are derived from the pattached problem statement.
 
 > Lab 5 contains an Extended Kalman Filter implementation for a non-linear system with given data and derived state transition and state update equations.
 
 > Lab 6 contains a Particle Filter implementation for a non-gaussian distribution system with given data.

Reports for all three implementations have been attached with the respective code files.
